# Hey there! 👋

I'm Carlo, an AI engineer from Italy.

I like taking vague ideas (“what if an AI could help swim coaches?” or “can I get 3D poses from these cameras?”) and turning them into working tools. Sometimes they become full projects, sometimes they stay as strange experiments in a notebook.

Most of what I build lives somewhere between **LLMs**, **computer vision**, and **simulations**. I play with multi-agent systems, 3D pose estimation, and GPU-accelerated experiments for wireless and communication systems.

My main tech stack is `Python`, `PyTorch`, `LangChain`, `FastAPI`, `Docker`, a bit of `TensorFlow`, usually running on `AWS` or `GCP`. I spend way too much time in VS Code, Jupyter, and the terminal.

I've got a few pinned projects, but my current favorite is **SwimMind**, an AI platform that helps swim coaches plan training and escape spreadsheets. I’m also fond of a **Home Repair Assistant** built with LLM agents, and a **3D basketball pose** project using an 8-camera rig.

I’ve stopped counting how many repos I’ve started. The public ones are the tidy part – the real chaos lives in private prototypes and half-finished tools.

Fun Facts:

- I’m doing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence Systems at the University of Trento  
- I like reading research papers and then trying to break them with tiny experiments  
- I play with blockchain data and simple algo-trading strategies for fun  
- I weirdly enjoy debugging more than writing “hello world”  
- Hobbies: building side projects, learning new tools, overthinking system design
