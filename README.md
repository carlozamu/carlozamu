# Hey there! 👋

I'm [Carlo](https://carlozamuner.it), an AI engineer based in Italy.

I design and build AI systems that mix large language models, computer vision, and a bit of simulation.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll turn it into a prototype, then push it until it’s useful for someone who isn’t me.

My main tech stack is Python, PyTorch, LangChain, FastAPI, and Docker. I usually ship things on AWS or Google Cloud.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is [SwimMind](https://swimmind.web.app), an AI assistant that helps swim coaches plan and adapt training sessions.

Most of my experiments start in notebooks and end up as APIs, dashboards, or small tools running quietly in the cloud.

If you want to see more of what I build, my projects and notes are on my website: [carlozamuner.it](https://carlozamuner.it)


Fun Facts:

• I have a Google Sheet that tracks all my expenses and runs “what if” simulations for future me, just because I enjoy it  
• I actively invest part of my savings and treat it like a long-running experiment, not a get-rich-quick plan  
• I’m happiest either in the pool or on the slopes – swimming and skiing are my reset buttons  
• I love landing in a new city with no strict plan and just walking around to see what I find
